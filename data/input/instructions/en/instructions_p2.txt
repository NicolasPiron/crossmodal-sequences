After seeing a series of sequences, you will have to answer questions.
Each question occurs in three steps:
- The first presented item serves to identify the sequence.
- The second item is the target; you must remember its position.
- Once both items have been presented, you must place the second item in the correct position. You have 2 seconds to do so.
