# to add : 

- rewards in random blocks / trials (in virtual points)

# to complete :

- get all the stims
- finish the experiment (2 runs of 4 blocks?)

# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
