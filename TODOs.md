# to add : 

- increase randomization. Sequence structure stays the same across subjects but stims need to change. 
- trigger/events info. Start with something like a mock port that sends info to csv instead of MEG screen. 
- rewards in random blocks / trials (in virtual points). 
- associate sound to sequence (should be pseudo-randomized)
- questions at the end of the run to test exaustive knowledge of the participants. 

# to complete/modify :

## stimuli :
- cut characters' images to see only the face.
- chose more dissimilar female characters. 
- colorful landscapes. 
- black and white body parts. 
- change 'hair' to torso. 
- soften the diff between background and image background.
- control for luminosity diff. 

## structural
- change the question. More time to think about the order (1st item of the list apearing (5s), then one of the 5 other).
- use frames instead of time. 
- keep track of everything that happens (timing and order of stim and questions.)

# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
