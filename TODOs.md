# to add : 

- test functions for the block / trial org generation
- rewards in random blocks. 
- associate sound to sequence (should be pseudo-randomized)

# to complete/modify :

## structural
- "which sequences stay grouped" distribution. Above run level organization.
- change question.
- feedback no 1 pt.  


## stimuli :
- cut characters' images to see only the face.
- chose more dissimilar female characters. 
- colorful landscapes. 
- black and white body parts. 
- change 'hair' to torso. 
- soften the diff between background and image background.
- control for luminosity diff. 


# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
