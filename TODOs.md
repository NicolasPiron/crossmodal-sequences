IMPORTANT: port to python 3.9 to work with https://fcbg-platforms.github.io/byte-triggers/index.html

# to add : 

- rewards in random blocks / trials (in virtual points). 
- associate sound to sequence (should be pseudo-randomized)
- questions at the end of the run to test exaustive knowledge of the participants. 

# to complete/modify :

## stimuli :
- cut characters' images to see only the face.
- chose more dissimilar female characters. 
- colorful landscapes. 
- black and white body parts. 
- change 'hair' to torso. 
- soften the diff between background and image background.
- control for luminosity diff. 

## structural
- change the question. More time to think about the order (1st item of the list apearing (5s), then one of the 5 other).
- use frames instead of time. 
- add jitter. 

# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
