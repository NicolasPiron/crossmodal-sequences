# to add : 

- test functions for the block / trial org generation
- rewards in random blocks / trials (in virtual points). 
- associate sound to sequence (should be pseudo-randomized)
- questions at the end of the run to test exaustive knowledge of the participants. 

# to complete/modify :

- remember that before modifying stims appearance, I need to be sure.
## stimuli :
- cut characters' images to see only the face.
- chose more dissimilar female characters. 
- colorful landscapes. 
- black and white body parts. 
- change 'hair' to torso. 
- soften the diff between background and image background.
- control for luminosity diff. 

## structural
- "which sequences stay grouped" distribution. Above run level organization. 

# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
