# to add : 

- trigger/events info
- rewards in random blocks / trials (in virtual points)
- create a demo

# to complete :

- error with sequence sampling?
- save csv and overwrite
- add more text (e.g. end of the run, or new block) + feedback?
- change the question. More time to think about the order (one picture apearing before the other?)

# to keep in mind :

- pseudo-randomization. I need to keep count of everything that has happened
- sequence structure is maybe not important anymore as we have only 6 sequences (or we can keep the 3 structures for the 6 sequences)
